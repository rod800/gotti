<H2>About</H2>
<P>The popularity of Bully dogs as pets to lovers is increasing, but they are 
still uncommon or is some cases rare in terms of rarity. The main reason for 
this is that many breeders did not breed tricolored dogs for several generations 
since they can be mistaken as mixed breeds and mixed breed Bullies are something 
breeders try to avoid producing. The caution of the breeders is understandable 
since a pure-breed Bully dog with a distinguished pedigree is one of the many 
traits valued by any potential buyer. There is also the fact that many breeders 
prioritize the game qualities rather than the aesthetics of coat color in the 
Bullyâ€™s original sires the American Staffordshire Dog and the American Pit 
Bull Terrier. As a result, the Bully gene pool rarely produces tri-colored dogs 
even when breeders try to breed them purposely into existence.</P>
